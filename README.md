# CoastalBench: A Decade-Long High-Resolution Dataset to Emulate Complex Coastal Processes

## Data Availability
Due to the large scale of the dataset, we are currently exploring suitable platforms for public hosting. In the meantime, the dataset is available **upon request**. Please contact us directly if you are interested in accessing the data. A 90-day preview subset is publicly hosted on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/YupuZ/CoastalBench-preview
